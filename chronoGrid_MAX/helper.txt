chronoGrid Max tool :

# chronoGrid is a multilayer euclydian sequencer
	. you can write patterns and layer them
	. it does not stick to the grid so you are freed from live's midi grid
	. you can modify (rotate) each layer independently without impacting surrounding layers
	. It has a grid mode (vertical) and a clock mode (clockwise)
	
# chronoGrid has it's own syntax
	. the syntax is dumb but clear : x is a note, - is a silence
	. the amount of character you write determines the amount of steps contained in the written patterns
	. there are not limit on the amount of steps you can write
	. from now, the output is limited to one bar but i'll fix that eventually
	. you can delay the starting point by entering a phase starting point (float).
	
# chronoGrid allows you to handle midiclip
	. chronoGrid allows you to select the slots where you want to create midi clip
	. you can choose the length in 1/4ters notes (float numbers) of the created clip
	. you can select and fill midi clips at will
	. midi clips can be rewritten at will
	
# chronoGrid simply needs you to respect the steps : 
	1 create patterns using the text space
	2 create a midi clip in the selected midi clip slot
	3 fill selected midi clips
	
you probably need to install node (to handle js) but not sure.
Questions and issues can be asked in github request and issues spaces.
