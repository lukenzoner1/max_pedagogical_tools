With this timer you get the time in ms between 2 kicks (which is sometimes the loudest sound of all), but you can adapt this system to other use. It's rather logical thinking than ready to go.
Read your buffered track (try a basic 4x4 loop with hat, kick snare) using play~, cycle~ or wave~, then use snapshot~ or left outlet of number~, then you can set some bolean to get event bangs.
