# chronoGrid 
this tool is widely and freely inspired by Katy Basset's numerical Gamelan representation, nothing to do with Gamelan's music tho.
Use to generate cool patterns and polyrythm, I'll eventually update it sometimes.

# chronoGrid_MAX
M4L version with different implementation for M4L

# Get_time
With this timer you get the time in ms between 2 events, that's all...
